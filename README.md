# Managing Token symbol and name

DeFi changes rapidly and we provide a method for you to override the default token names and symbols stored on-chain.

1. Add your token to the `/<chain>/tokens.json` file
2. Use the check summed <address> as the key
3. Conform to this object format

```
{
  "<your-token-address>": {
    name: "<your-new-name>"
    symbol: "<your-new-symbol>",
    tags: []
  }
}
```

## Token tags

We provide a default set of tags to categorise tokens, please only use tags in the default set which can be found at `/tokens-tag.json` and be honest, if you are launching a degen meme token, do not tag it as a blue-chip or your token submission will be rejected. If a team attempts to trick users then delisting and/or removal of gauges may occur.
